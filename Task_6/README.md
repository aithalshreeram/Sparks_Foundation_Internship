# Task 6

##    Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

###    (Level - Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
